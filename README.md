Here, I have tried to control the inverted pendulum at its unstable equilibrium point, i.e., upright position using various control techniques. As of now, I have implemented a PID and state feedback controller in another repository [controller-comparoson](https://github.com/KaranJagdale/controller_comparison/tree/master) In this repository I tried unconventinal method of reinforcement learning for controling the inverted pendulumn.
